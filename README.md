# Chicken farm Simulator
 This is a python bases game where players take on the role of a farm manager,starting with two chickens,a limited amount of money and a fresh plot of land .The objective is to cultivate a successful chicken farm by managing resources, such as purchasing water and planting grass to feed the chickens, which will produce eggs over time if properly cared for. Players must balance their finances carefully, as each action, such as buying additional chickens or resources, has a cost associated with it. The game introduces an element of unpredictability with random wolf attacks occurring every three seconds, where a wolf has a chance to appear and threaten the chicken population. To fend off the wolf, players are presented with a randomly generated alpha-numeric string they must type correctly within a limited time to cage the wolf and earn additional funds. The game ends when all chickens are dead or when the player runs out of money and cannot purchase more chickens, at which point a summary of the player's achievements, including the total number of chickens raised, eggs produced, and final earnings, is displayed. Through its combination of resource management, strategy, and quick typing challenges, the Chicken Farm Simulator offers an entertaining and educational experience for players.
